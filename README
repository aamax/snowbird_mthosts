Mthost
========================

This application is used to manage the Mt Host program at The Snowbird Ski Resort in Utah.
There are about 75+ hosts each year with over 1300 shifts to schedule and manage.
this site allows users to select shifts and handle all the management needed to keep the
program running all year.  it is also a central hub for program information and external resources
that are helpful for our users.


the site uses twitter bootstrap and angularjs in various locations.  it is always a work in progress.
I welcome feedback and suggestions - I still consider myself pretty new to rails and web dev in general.

thanks,

Max
